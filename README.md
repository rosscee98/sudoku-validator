# Sudoku validator

These programs take in an array of Sudoku solutions and determine their validity. If a solution is invalid, an explanation is logged to console.

Two validators are here, one written in Python and the other in Go. (For the code challenge, we win points based on using a unique language - my bet is on Python for this! The Go solution is just for fun.)

To test the Python solution, run from the project root:
```
python3 python/main.py
```

To test the Go solution, run from the project root:
```
go run go/main.go
```
